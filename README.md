# 16-Point-FFT
This repository contains the fixed point modelling, RTL implementation and verification of a 16-point radix 2 FFT algorithm using the pipelined single commutator delay (SDC) architecture. In the MATLAB model the SNR due to fixed point quantisation is calculated and verification is done by inputing a file with input vector and comparing the RTL output to that of the one in MATLAB.
